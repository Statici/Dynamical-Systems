# Dynamical-Systems

A collection of matlab functions and scripts for handling proposed functions from the book "Discovering Discrete Dynamical Systems."

If you'd like to generate a web diagram, use "webdiagramtest." The instructions on how to use it are inside; you do NOT run webDiagram by itself as it is a matlab function that must be called from another script. Both files must be in the same directory.
